// Follow the steps below to create a **while** loop that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) create a variable to represent the current number
let x = 1;
// 2) create a variable to represent the current total
let t = 0;
// 3) write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
while (x<=100){
  t = t + x;
  x++;

  }

  console.log(t);


t = 0;
// Now using the same variables you created in steps 1 and 2, create a **for** loops that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100
for (let t = 1; x <= 100; x ++ );
  {
  t=x;

  }

console.log(t);
// 1) write a for loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
